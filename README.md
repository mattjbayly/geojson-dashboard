# Bryan McBride's geojson-dashboard project - for PHP

This amazing project was originally created by Bryan McBride (Niskayuna, NY) and forked into this repository. The purpose of this fork is to reconfigure some of the geojson import settings & hook it up to PHP with AJAX requests. I just started working with these files March 17th 2017 – just for fun. I also hope to address some very very minor style issues with original content & send a pull request back to Bryan. If you’re reading this … I still haven’t really done anything with the project yet & will try to make changes soon.
